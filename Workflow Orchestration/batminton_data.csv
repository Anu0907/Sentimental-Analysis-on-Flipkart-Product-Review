"Nice product, good quality, but price is now rising which is a bad sign. 800-850 was an affordable price, especially when we play everyday. So kindly help us out in terms of the price. Thank You.",1
They didn't supplied Yonex Mavis 350. Outside cover was Yonex Ad inside was a cheapest....  Sad to hear this.,0
Worst product. Damaged shuttlecocks packed in new box. It's not a original yonex product. Don't buy.flipkart platform is chosen to fraud the buyers.,0
Good quality product. Delivered on time.,1

"This is the second time i am getting an opened bundle of Yonex mavis 350 shuttle. I really believe this is not an original product, or someone may have switched the shuttle inside the bundle. Don't buy from flipkart. I am gonna return this product.",0

Very nice and Good price compare then local sports.,1
It's perfect. Go for it. Yonex will never disappoint you. Pros - 1. The feather might look little cheap at first glance but it ain't like that. The quality it best.2. The bottom cork is so amazing. We play in an open court and it perfectly glides around. Balanced base. 3. The durability seems to go fine. No issues on that. We (intermediate players) have been using one shuttle since 2 days now. Cons - 1. Slightly on a higher range. 2. If you use 30lbs + BG 65 or 98 racquet then it's p...,1

Received in good condition...am really satisfied with the product.But I am not satisfied with those delivery boys who always does not have coins in return...it means that we are paying extra money for our item. They also know this opportunity so they never have coins to return...I really dont like this kind of selfishness!,1

No one better shuttles in the market.good quality and reasonable price.,1

Superb quality... And best price.. Thanks to flipkart..!,1
second quality shuttles .. don't buy it... all are almost torn and shaped out... worst experience... go and buy in shop which costs around 750-800,0
I don't think it is genuine cos I had it checked on the official website of yonex with the hologram number. Yet product is not bad and it does the job well. I will definitely be comparing this one with an original one from a shop near by and let others know the difference if any.,1
"I've Received 6 duplicate n cheapest balls ,kept inside a broken box, which it was done deleberately. Worst experience, I've ever had with Flipkart. Can buy anything, except badminton yonex mavis 350.",0

"The yonex Mavis 350 is the best among all the yonex shuttlecocks. I am playing with it for more than one year. But the price is increasing unnecessarily, it was Rs. 729 in the last year.",1
Very bad product quality i have used 3shuttle in only 3days Totally wastage of money Copied product,0
All shuttle's were heavier than the specifications. It felt like we were playing with a cheap rip off of the original MAVIS 350,0

"Excellent Product , Its 100% original product which i have received , Fast Delivery , No second tough go for it.....",1
One of the best offer given by My flipkart. best shuttle for tournaments and training. Always use this type of shuttles for play. No.1- yonex 350mavis Green. thanks to flipkart for best deal . always put these type of deal . i have booked for 599 only.......,1
"good . no question about it . lasting for 15-20 matches . but you can purchase yonex mavis 350 blue one . little bit fast but good for smash , lasting same like green cap",1
Mavis 350 is quite durable and and really good for starters. But I recommend Mavis 500 for best practice sessions.,1
"Received product before committed time. Thanks flipkart... This mavis 350 is really awesome product. It doesn't matter whether you are beginners, intermediate or advanced level of player this mavis 350 is definitely perfectly works for all. I am playing with this from last 2 years.",1
"Good ,very nicely packed and everyshuttle was very nice insude with perfect flight.",1
"got this product earlier than expected at Rs689 on 7 th april 2018  on sale. box was properly sealed with Feb2018 packing/import date i m not sure but Mrp was 1040. so, for me it was way cheaper than market price here (Rs 750 per box). I also checked popular websites but no one was close to Flipkart at that point. I always use Mavis 350 green cap for its stability, durability and speed in open court. Thanks Flipkart, hoping cheaper deal again.",1
"This is the best choice for people who wants to practice both indoor and outdoor badminton and not get into financial obligations of feather shuttle. Mavis 300 is hard to find at times, so 350 is a savior as it's always available. Yellow ones are a bit better for outdoor and white is fine indoors because of their respective colours against the given backdrop. Flipkart has offered best price in almost all season so far. Longevity of the shuttles are starkly less when played with at outdoor due...",1
"After a long time, got an entire box of genuine shuttles. Dynamic pricing strategy is a big no. Everyday prices can't go up and down. Otherwise we would be more than happy to buy.",1
very good product n durable but not good enough speed slows down little in mid air,1
The shuttles were imported in February 2018 (bought March last) and the serial number revealed after scratching the sticker shows that the item is genuine. Did not start to play yet. But the items look good and sturdy. Got it for 708 and i think it is worth for the price. Also happy to get the items delivered quickly.,1
Best shuttlecocks... It's life is far better than li ning or any other shuttle in this price range... I purchased it from rs654  during sale... It's flight is also better than other shuttlecocks,1
Good n Nice balanced shuttles... Thanks retailnet n flipkart.. Hope we'l get more convincing rates of lowered one...,1
"This shuttle is the best one, it is excellent 👍 price doesn't matter ❤️",1
"Quality  very bad,per day one cork finished,may be it look like duplicate  mavis 350 corks.I purchased  many cork boxes  from all sellers.that all cork  boxes  comes  15 days  for playing, but this box stays only 6 days ,so you understand  how delicate this cork box  is",0
Cost is too high I hate the product,0
Very poor quality...inconsistent speed...poor flight,0
Yonex is always best in quality....,1
worst shuttle... these doesn't last even for a day... very poor quality... not sure if it is due to stock issue or is that a copy product... I would never buy this through flipkart...,0
"i have used this product. good for economic use. Durable and good balance. long lasting, even sustains wrong shots. Quiet economic when compared with Feather Shuttles.",1
I'm very happy with this product and its quality. It arrived before its actual delivery date given. Thanks Flipkart for your quick delivery.  I recommended it to everyone who would like to enjoy a longer and satisfied games.,1
Amazing shuttlecockDurable and of best qualityGo for it.,1
checked at Sunrisetnt.com . found genuine,1
Horrible!!! In my 1st order I received Mavis 200i which was not sealed and the bill was of Mavis 350 I thought it was mistake then i asked for replacement in replacement I received box of Mavis 350 which was again not sealed and inside were cheap shuttles of local quality. Do not buy from Flipkart.,0
Average,0
"Excellent synthetic shuttles from Yonex. I have used 350s, 500s as well as 2000s. I prefer these yellow ones for the visibility. In general the 350s are quite durable and long lasting (one shuttle can easily last half a dozen to a dozen intense games before the flight becomes unacceptable), and i found them to travel shorter distances than the 2000s and therefore prefer them.",1
Best shuttle available in the market. I have not used any other shuttles till now. So not aware of a better shuttle.The price I got it from Flipkart is really the best price. I have researched checking other online stores and sports shops. This is definitely the best price I could find.,1

"Poor quality, shuttle become broke within 3-4 hour playing .ie within 1 day",0
The shuttles worn off really quickly. More quickly than a regular mavis 350 does. So I tried to verify the authenticity of the product by entering the code on it onto the website and lo it was a genuine product.I've attached the pictures for reference. It developed a hairline crack so quickly after just half a match. All other shuttles had the same quality.,0
Nice product best price super,1
Optimum weight and speed.. Easy to control the shots and easy court cover.  Good for learners and even beginners.. Base is not that of thermocol type material like its there in other yonex shurttles.. its a cork base so doesn't  get ruptured easily..  Worth buying👍,1
It's not suitable for outdoor,0
It seems it is not original. Lighter and not lasting for more than an hour of play.,0
Horrible shuttle I ever play,0
"Finally got orginal yonex mavis 350.Genuine piece.There are so many fakes avilable in market.so serious players buy from here, you wont regret.",1
"Item received in excellent condition, that too within one day. Thanks to the team. However one suggestion, please don't send the item in such a big cardboard box. Its actually a wastage of resources.",1
Used both the boxes... People who say they are fake have either never played with mavis 350 or may have received a damaged box that might have disturbed the flight of the shuttle.... For me who plays with mavis 350 day in and day out... It is absolutely original and being speed 75...it plays well in Delhi heat above 35 degrees.... Will order more,1
"Product is good as like as bought in the open market. Price also is equal to open market. It would be good in on line, if price is less.",1
nice items,1
Thank you flipkart for providing such a great product with good quality and great deal.,1

I love it.....It is really very guudAs well as it has a fantastic delivery It's so early also,1
it's really good shuttle.  if you  want to improve your game it's best and also durable . it's flight is good and weight balance is superb.  it's best for amateur  level,1

Good one for us. We play outdoor everyday. Constant play for 2 hours. The shuttle lasted for three weeks. We don't play professional but we do play hard. And few of us are not really good so we hit the shuttle with the rod as well. But still the shuttle is good. The one point I removed is for the plastic which starts to get ruptured and the price should be within middle class range. It is a little higher.,1

2 shuttle out of 6 was partially Manufacturing defected. product was looking original. Seller should pay attention that customer is paying amount for 6 shuttle.,1
Good turst it,1
Worst product I think Mavis 350 was more durable than average shuttle but thought of mine was a clear blunder as it doesn't lasts for at least 1day. The cork was broken after 6-7 set play. If you plays in indoor then you can go with this otherwise you will donated money to Flipkart,0

Excellent. First We ordered one Box and tried whether fake or genuine product. I selected slow 75. We found its genuine product with long lasting. Then we are playing with the same shuttle till now. I suggested it to other courts in our town. They are playing with same shuttle and buying from Flipkart. So go without any hesitation.,1
Packing is good,1
Yonex is great,1
The packing of the product was not done properly & not up to the mark. Request the team to take care of the same in future to avoid damaging the product.,1
Giving Review after 2 weeks of use.. Don't buy this product. It seems they are selling second grade defective product. All shuttle start to rotate after some time  it's very difficult to play.... Patethic product.,0

very low quality birdies. 3 out of the 6 birdies were gone in a day. They were wobbling from the very first hit. I bought 2 packs. need to see whether the second one is also like this or whether it was just one defective pack. I don't want to return it because I already used 3 of it in a day and it didn't seem good on me to return.,0

The box had got crushed in the cardboard box. Please don't pack in thin cardboard boxes. Instead pack it in plastic covers along with the bubble sheet wrapped around the box. This way the shuttles won't get damaged. Slightly out of shape......the shuttlles will not perform at all... So next time I order shuttles I expect a proper delivery without damage or else I will return.,0

"I have booked Mavis 350 , qty 3, after sometime flipkart cancelled my offer due to ""high demand for the product"". So my money got deducted. I think flipkart does this thing often and have liquid cash to deposit the money and earn interest overnight OND (Over night Deposit). So flipkart is benefiting with our money by cancelling the product. Request everyone to go for COD!!!",0
"Duplicate shuttlecock s in original containers , absolute cheating ..Fake shuttlecock signs1.bottom line is clearly square ( not so square in original )2.top line ..6 window's (5 in original)Rest check in YouTube vds or Google it",0
